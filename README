Doge fountain bot!

It's set up to use fido, but since fido is dead, it no longer works. I didn't feel like fixing it (not yet anyway), so I'm releasing it as public.

The passwords for nickserv and the admin login are given in a file called userpass in the same directory. It is organized as so:
nickservpass
adminpass

that's all. No other lines or anything, just the two, sparated by \n. The "admin" nick (the bot creator) is set via the variable in doge2.py:
adminnick=""

I don't know what else to put here.
